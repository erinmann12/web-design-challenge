# web-design-challenge

For this project, I was tasked with creating a website using CSS and HTML. Specifically I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations created in a previous assignment. Individual pages were created for each plot and an explanation of the plot shown. There is also a landing page with the project's summary, a comparison page of all the plots, and a data page with the data used to create the plots.
