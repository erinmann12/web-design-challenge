# web-design-challenge

**Background**

For this project, I was tasked with creating a website of seven different pages using CSS and HTML. Specifically I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations created in a previous assignment. 

**Tools Used**

1. HTML
2. CSS

**Project Tasks**

I started by creating a home page that summarized the projects and its corresponding visualizations.

Next,  I created individual pages for each plot and an explanation of the plot shown. There is also a comparison page of all the plots and a data page with the data used to create the plots.
